# Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data

This repository contains materials from the **4th and 5th Editions** of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data, held in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Our initiative is aimed at addressing the gap in Python programming skills among bioscientists in Brazil, equipping them with the necessary tools to handle and analyze complex biological datasets. The advancements and challenges encountered in these recent editions have been compiled into a manuscript, which can be  accessed using the following link:

## Abstract

The rapid evolution of high-throughput technologies in bioscience has generated diverse and voluminous datasets, necessitating enhanced data manipulation and analysis skills among bioscientists. The Python programming language, known for its versatility and powerful libraries, has become a critical tool in handling these datasets. However, there is a notable lack of training in Python for bioscientists in many countries. To address this gap of knowledge of scientists from Brazil, a new introductory initiative of Python training was implemented, focusing on basic programming concepts and advanced data handling techniques using popular Python libraries. This initiative aimed to enhance the scientific outcomes by empowering researchers with the necessary programming skills to navigate and analyze complex biological data. Despite the progress and positive feedback from previous sessions, challenges persist, necessitating continuous adaptation and improvement of the training programs to meet the evolving needs of bioscientists. This work discusses the developments in the latest editions of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data, highlighting the integration of community feedback, improvements in training methodologies, and the expansion of access to these educational resources. In conclusion, the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data has demonstrated significant progress in addressing the skill gaps among bioscientists concerning data analysis and programming. By adapting training content based on participant feedback and evolving scientific needs, the workshop has successfully enhanced participants' proficiency in Python, facilitating more effective data manipulation and analysis. This initiative not only bolsters individual researcher capabilities but also contributes to the broader scientific community by promoting the use of reproducible research practices and fostering a collaborative learning environment. As the workshop evolves, ongoing refinements and expanded access will be crucial to sustain its impact and reach within the global bioscience community.

## Workshop Structure

The full description of the workshop structure from both editions can be found bellow: 

Similar to the 2020 edition, both editions were structured online with the introduction of analysis, organization and data extraction using Python through practical sessions, employing a participatory live coding format [[18]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090). We designed both workshops to take place around five days of immersive Python learning, with a one-day break for exercises (S1 Table and S2 Table). They encompassed introductory sessions covering language syntax concepts and practical classes involving Python coding and programming logic. Lectures were developed using interactive digital notebooks on the Google Collaboratory platform (https://colab.research.google.com/). During problem-solving and concept presentations, instructors actively wrote and narrated the code for the students. We encouraged the students to write, document, and run their own code independently and concurrently. The full description of the schedule for both editions can be found in the repository link: In 2021, the practical sessions involved the manipulation of tabulated data, exploratory analysis with graphs, exploration of epidemiological data [[19]](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1), and biological diversity. In 2022, the practical sessions involved manipulation of tabulated data, exploratory analysis with graphs, introduction to the manipulation of biological sequences, and exploration of size measurements for three species of penguins observed in different islands of Antarctica [[20]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081). In both years, the third day of the workshop was reserved for required activities. In 2021, individual and group activities were required, whereas in 2022, only group activities were mandatory. Individual activities have become optional to reduce the workload on participants. A daily seminar related to the applied use of the Python language was given. On the fifth day, a special session called Flash Talks was held with selected participants for short presentations on their research, followed by a discussion on how the Python language could be applied to their own studies. All event communications - updates, and information throughout the event - were conducted using online platforms such as Slack (2021) and Discord (2022). For synchronous classes and presentations, we used Google Meet (https://meet.google.com/). An optional meeting preceding the workshop was scheduled with participants to clarify doubts related to the use of the platforms and as a way to minimize eventual technical complications. During the event, students were instructed to share errors and technical problems on the mentioned communication platforms (i.e. Slack or Discord) for immediate assistance from teaching assistants, for example, in solving syntax, semantics, and other general problems. As the days passed, students took it upon themselves to correct each other's mistakes and share feedback for solving exercises and technical issues among their peers.
